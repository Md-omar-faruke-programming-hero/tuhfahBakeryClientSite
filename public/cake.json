        "description":"Many a kid's birthday party is celebrated with a sheet-cake version of this dessert that's topped with billows of chocolate frosting and rainbow sprinkles. Yellow butter cakes often involve creaming the butter and sugar together (in modern times, this is done with an electric mixer) then adding the dry and wet ingredients, but there are also “dump” versions where all of the ingredients are thrown into a bowl and simply mixed together."

        "description":"Named because it's made with a pound of each of the main ingredients (flour, butter, and sugar), this cake doesn’t rise much while baking, and the texture is very dense. Our version boasts matcha and cocoa powder, but classic recipes have nothing but vanilla extract to flavor it. Bake up one of these beauties in a loaf or Bundt pan."

        "description":"This is a true favorite, especially in the south. Made with either butter or oil, red velvet cake's color classically comes from the reaction of buttermilk and cocoa powder. Modern versions often achieve this hue by using red food coloring, or in the case of the raspberry velvet cake, shown here, pink."

Carrot cake is also flavored with warm spices and frosted with a rich cream cheese frosting. Pecans or walnuts are optional!"

This cake takes well to being soaked in a flavored syrup (try soaking with a lemon syrup and serve with a dollop of lemon curd), layered with whipped cream and smashed berries, or if baked up thin, rolled in the Christmas classic, Buche de Noel"

Baked in a special angel food cake pan, it’s often cooled upside down (in the pan) to help maintain the airy texture. The loads of sugar in an angel food cake give it a chewy and sponge-like texture."

The toppings are spread on the bottom of the pan, often with butter and sugar, and then topped with cake batter. After cooking, the cake is turned out so that the fruit is facing up."
